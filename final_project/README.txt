After unzipping the folder, you have to run the code (folder) in an anacoda environment. So opening it on 
VSCODE through anacoda or jupyter notebook would both work. There should be five different .ipynb files 
that correspond to each dataset and one extra credit dataset. All the code and the long answer 
questions should be in the corresponding files: 
     Problem 1: final_project_handwritten_digets.ipynb.ipynb
     Problem 2: final_project_titanic.ipynb
     Problem 3: loan_datatset.ipynb
     Problem 4: parkinsons_datatset.ipynb
     Extra Credit #2:german_credit_datatset.ipynb
To run the code, just press RUN ALL in the command bar in the window. All the graphs will print and the 
long form answers are at the bottom and everything is in order. Look at the comments to see where everything 
is.
