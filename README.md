**The goal of this project is to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms
I implemented throughout the semester by testing them on four new, challenging datasets.
By performing these comparisons, I gain practical experience in selecting an algorithm (based on
a given problem) and optimizing its hyper-parameters so that it works well. </br> In addition, these analyses
give me insight into how to solve novel machine learning problemsâ€”problems where no one tells
me which algorithms may work best nor how to adjust their hyper-parameters.**
